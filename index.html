        <p> If you stumbled onto this page, you either had to(sorry Ben) or you were curious about who the heck I am!
            Well, my name is Jonathan and I have had the opportunity to call Ohio my home for over a decade now. During
            that time I worked in Hospiality Management. I was happy, worked with some great people, developed a love
            for food and saw how that desire to create could push you to make something memorable. So with that, I
            decided to take the plunge and pursue Software Development. </p>
