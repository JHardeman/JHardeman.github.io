            <p> If you stumbled onto this page, you either had to(sorry Ben) or you were curious about who the heck I
                am!
                Well, my name is Jonathan and I have had the opportunity to call Ohio my home for over a decade now.
                During
                that time I worked in Hospiality Management. I was happy, worked with some great people, developed a
                love
                for food and saw how that desire to create could push you to make something memorable. So with that, I
                decided to take the plunge and pursue Software Development. </p>

                their pet.<br>
