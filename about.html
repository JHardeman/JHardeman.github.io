        <p class="biography">Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. My name is Jonathan, I am originally from Florida, and have had the opportunity to call Ohio my home for over a decade now. During that time, I worked in Hospitality Management, was surrounded by some great people and developed a passion for food. That passion has cultivated a desire to create memorable experiences. So, itâ€™s with that same enthusiasm for creativity I have entered the field of technology and Software Development, a field of endless potential to make something truly great</p>
